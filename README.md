# FEM-1D-SOLVER
This project develops a one-dimensional Finite Element Method (FEM) solver in Python. It applies the Galerkin method with 1D Lagrange basis functions and employs second-order Gaussian Quadrature for numerical integration. The solver supports Forward Euler (FE) and Backward Euler (BE) methods for time-stepping.

Solver Methods: Implements both Forward Euler and Backward Euler methods.
Basis Functions: Uses 1D Lagrange basis functions for spatial discretization.
Gaussian Quadrature: Employs 2nd order Gaussian Quadrature for numerical integration.
User Interaction: Allows user input for nodes, timesteps, and solver methods.
